<h1 id="sander-tonkens">Sander Tonkens</h1>
<p>I'm a first year Ph.D. student at UC San Diego, advised by <a href="http://sylviaherbert.com/">Sylvia Herbert</a>. My interests lie at the intersection of robotics, control theory, and machine learning. My website is under construction and should be live by the End of October (do hold me accountable if it's not!)</p>
